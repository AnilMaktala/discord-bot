# Notes

add HTTP request template (shape discord response for easy consumption)

need to handle commands
need to register commands (with endpoint or special command?)
need to be able to register commands in one server
need to deploy lambdas to specific region
move sync to a command that can only be run by mods, etc.

need command return type of "standard response" or string

when synth/deploying locally it is recommended to install esbuild globally
